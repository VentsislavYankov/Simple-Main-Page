            Super Mario Bros., the first side-scrolling 2D platform game to feature Mario, was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1985. 
            It was derived through collaboration by Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka as a successor to the 1983 arcade game Mario Bros., which starred two 
            characters: Mario, the titular character that first appeared in Donkey Kong as the original player character and its sequel where he was a final boss, and Luigi, 
            who first appeared in Mario Bros.Super Mario Bros. established many core Mario elements, such as Goombas, Koopa Troopas, Bowser, Peach, and its three power-ups: the Super Mushroom,
             increasing the character's size and providing an extra hit point, Fire Flower, allowing the character to throw fireballs as weapons, and Super Star, granting temporary invincibility.
             The etymology of "Super" in the title came from the integration of the Super Mushroom into the game.The brothers Mario and Luigi must rescue Princess Toadstool/Peach from Bowser/King Koopa
              in the Mushroom Kingdom. The game consists of eight worlds of four levels each, totaling 32 levels altogether. Though the worlds differ in themes, the fourth level is always
               a fortress or castle that ends with a fight against Bowser (or one of his minions disguised as him).Super Mario Bros. is one of the best-selling video games of all time

            Mortal Kombat is an American media franchise centered on a series of video games originally developed by Midway Games in 1992.
             The development of the first game was originally based on an idea that Ed Boon and John Tobias had of making a video game 
             starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, but when that idea fell through, a science fantasy-themed fighting game was created instead. 
             Still, the developers paid homage to him with Johnny Cage (one of the main characters in the many games), a fictional film 
             star whose personal style resembles Van Damme's. The original game spawned many sequels with several action-adventure games.
              It also has a comic book series and a card game.Mortal Kombat has become the best-selling fighting game franchise worldwide
               and one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time. The series has a reputation for high levels of graphic violence,
                including, most notably, its fatalities, which are finishing moves that kill the defeated opponents instead of knocking them out. 
                Controversies surrounding Mortal Kombat, in part, led to the creation of the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) video 
                game rating system. Early games in this series were also noted for their realistic digitized sprites and an extensive use of 
                palette swapping to create new characters. Following Midway's bankruptcy, the MK development team was acquired by Warner Bros.
                 Entertainment and reestablished as NetherRealm Studios

            Counter-Strike (CS) is a series of multiplayer first-person shooter video games in which teams of terrorists battle 
            to perpetrate an act of terror (bombing, hostage-taking, assassination) while counter-terrorists try to prevent it 
            (bomb defusal, hostage rescue, escort mission). The series began on Windows in 1999 with the release of the first game,
             Counter-Strike. It was initially released as a modification ("mod") for Half-Life that was designed by Minh "Gooseman" 
             Le and Jess "Cliffe" Cliffe before the rights to the mod's intellectual property were acquired by Valve, the developers
              of Half-Life, who then turned Counter-Strike into a retail product released in 2000.

             by British development house Rockstar North (formerly DMA Design), and published by its parent company, Rockstar Games. The name
